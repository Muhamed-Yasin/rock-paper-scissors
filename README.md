# rock-paper-scissors
This is a terminal-based rps game simulator with a game loop to get multiple tries without the need of re-running the program.
You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.

If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

Rock smashes scissors.
Paper covers rock.
Scissors cut paper.

The usage of this script is pretty straightforward. You will be given the three choices and the computer will be picking one at random, and you can repeat this as many times as you want.
